## Common Security Concepts

---

## CIA Triads
- Confidentiality: Keep data private (e.g., encryption).
- Integrity: Ensure data isn't tampered with (e.g., checksums).
- Availability: Make sure systems are up and accessible (e.g., redundant systems).
## AuthN and AuthZ
**AuthN (Authentication)**
- Proves who you are (e.g., login with username + password).
  
**AuthZ (Authorization)**
- Defines what you're allowed to do (e.g., read-only access vs admin).
