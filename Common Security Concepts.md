## Common Security Concepts

---

## CIA Triads
- Confidentiality: Keep data private (e.g., encryption).
- Integrity: Ensure data isn't tampered with (e.g., checksums).
- Availability: Make sure systems are up and accessible (e.g., redundant systems).
## AuthN and AuthZ
**AuthN (Authentication)**
- Proves who you are (e.g., login with username + password).
  
**AuthZ (Authorization)**
- Defines what you're allowed to do (e.g., read-only access vs admin).
## MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Using two or more of: something you know (password), have (phone), or are (fingerprint).
## 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
- A type of MFA using exactly two different factors.
## OAuth2.0
- A secure authorization protocol: lets apps access your data without sharing your password (e.g., "Login with Google").
## SSO (Single Sign-On)
- Login once, access many systems (e.g., Google account to access Gmail, Drive, YouTube).
