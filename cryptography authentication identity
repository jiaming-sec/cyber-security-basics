## Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing vs Obfuscation vs Signing
- Be able to explain the differences between these things.
- Various attack models (e.g. chosen-plaintext attack).

## Encryption standards + implementations
- RSA (asymmetrical).
- AES (symmetrical).
- ECC (namely ed25519) (asymmetric).
- Chacha/Salsa (symmetric).

## Asymmetric vs symmetric
- Asymmetric is slow, but good for establishing a trusted connection.
- Symmetric has a shared key and is faster. Protocols often use asymmetric to transfer symmetric key.
- Perfect forward secrecy - eg Signal uses this.

## Cyphers
- Block vs stream ciphers.
- Block cipher modes of operation.
- AES-GCM.
