## Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing vs Obfuscation vs Signing
- Be able to explain the differences between these things.
- Various attack models (e.g. chosen-plaintext attack).

## Encryption standards + implementations
- RSA (asymmetrical).
- AES (symmetrical).
- ECC (namely ed25519) (asymmetric).
- Chacha/Salsa (symmetric).
