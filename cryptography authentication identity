## Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing vs Obfuscation vs Signing
- Be able to explain the differences between these things.
- Various attack models (e.g. chosen-plaintext attack).

## Encryption standards + implementations
- RSA (asymmetrical).
- AES (symmetrical).
- ECC (namely ed25519) (asymmetric).
- Chacha/Salsa (symmetric).

## Asymmetric vs symmetric
- Asymmetric is slow, but good for establishing a trusted connection.
- Symmetric has a shared key and is faster. Protocols often use asymmetric to transfer symmetric key.
- Perfect forward secrecy - eg Signal uses this.

## Cyphers
- Block vs stream ciphers.
- Block cipher modes of operation.
- AES-GCM.

## Integrity and authenticity primitives
- Hashing functions e.g. MD5, Sha-1, BLAKE. Used for identifiers, very useful for fingerprinting malware samples.
- Message Authentication Codes (MACs).
- Keyed-hash MAC (HMAC).

## Authentication

- Certificates
What info do certs contain, how are they signed?
Look at DigiNotar.
- Trusted Platform Module
(TPM)
Trusted storage for certs and auth data locally on device/host.
- O-auth
Bearer tokens, this can be stolen and used, just like cookies.
- Auth Cookies
Client side.
- Sessions
Server side.
- Auth systems
SAMLv2o.
OpenID.
Kerberos.
Gold & silver tickets.
Mimikatz.
Pass-the-hash.
